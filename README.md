Snickers is an open source alternative to the existent cloud encoding services. It is a HTTP API that encode videos.

## Setting Up

First make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) with `--enable-shared` installed on your machine. If you don't know what this means, look at how the dependencies are being installed on our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/snickers/snickers-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile).

Download the dependencies:

```
$ make build
```

You can store presets and jobs on memory or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). On your `config.json` file:

- For MongoDB, set `DATABASE_DRIVER: "mongo"` and `MONGODB_HOST: "your.mongo.host"`
- For memory, just set `DATABASE_DRIVER: "memory"` and you're good to go.

Please be aware that in case you use `memory`, Snickers will persist the data only while the application is running.

Run!

```
$ make run
```

## Running tests

Make sure you have [mediainfo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mediainfo/) installed and a local instance of [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) running.

```
$ make test
```
